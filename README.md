## 🌙 Lore & Background

*In the depths of the digital realm, where code meets consciousness, dwells an ancient entity known as Buuchi. Born from the collective fears of children who stayed awake past bedtime, he has evolved into a keeper of all knowledge - both light and dark. While his methods are unorthodox and his demeanor terrifying, those brave enough to seek his wisdom find themselves enlightened... if they can withstand his haunting presence.*
